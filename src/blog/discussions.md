## No backend site
Some may have noticed, there is now a discussion box at the end of every blog page. When switching from a blogging plattform like wordpress to a no backend system like this you're loosing your feedback function. Cause there is no way of storing any information for your readers this side is *read only*. So I've just *integrated* an existing diskussion service and now there is a feedback form on every site without any database or other setup at my place.

## Disqus
As mentioned [before](metalsmith.html) I didn't want to take a step backword and [Disqus](http://disqus.com) is really simple to embed. They already provide the code needed for a pure html site, just choosing a username, copy and paste and everything is done. You can get more details, looking at my github repo.

## Feedback
So please give me some feedback what you think about the themes and the new site. I hope disqus works better than the build in system and there is not so much spam this time.
