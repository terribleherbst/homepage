## Guardians of the JEE

Cause java is the de facto industry programming language of our time there is a lot of business interest for keeping the platform alive. Oracle is a different company than Sun was, last but not least in business culture. With Sun oracle bought Java (inlcuding JEE) but the ideas behind the ecosystem (like the JCP) don't fit into oracles way of thinking. Oracles seems to have no interest in an open standard platform. They have there customers and there products which help them to make a lot of money. Why should they help any compeditor to make an application server? Why should they help anybody to make money with Java at all?

I think a group like the JEE guardians is a pretty strong indicator something is going wrong. I just can't help this a not the way the (oracle) world works. Oracle is not an open minded company, they make their money with closed source and I guess they won't change this within the next years. I don't believe they will be successfull in the long term because of the large market share this will work pretty well. 

## Changing the lanuage

As an enterprise company you need a stable well estabished programming platform. So if JEE seems to lack long time support (even if it is just missing innovation) you must consider changing your plattform. But is there a real alternative? Of course there are a lot of programming languages and a lot of them are major and stable. You could use node.js or ruby, you could switch to .NET (using i.e. C#) or could pick up new stuff like Go or Rust. Unfortunately none of these language have prooved to be long time stable and supported (neither by the vendor nor by developers) so what can you do?

## Enterprise Java is more than JEE
Most none technical people see Java as the brand created by Sun Microsystems. But _Java_ is a lot of different things:

1. The Java (core) Language on the one site which is defined by the language specifications in different versions
2. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runtime environment
3. The libraries and specifications defining the Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)

Only the last of the three things is _broken_. You could create, write and run enterprise Java without any JEE dependency. You could even write none Java code (using an alternative JVM language (i.e. Groovy, Kotlin or Scala) and use all advantages of the industrial strengh JVM and all of your existing Java code.

## JEE is dead, long live Java

No doubt JEE is in trouble but Java as a plattform ist not. Project like Spring Boot show excellent possibilities moving Java into the cloud era. Language like Kotlin or Scala provide up to date programming possibilities within the Java eco system. So JEE is seriously in trouble but Java is still a valid platform for enterprise applications.
