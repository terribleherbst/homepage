# Vaadin developer day

Today I had the chance attending the Vaadin developer day in germany. It was the first *developer day*, something between a workshop and a conference. 

There were talks to different themes round about the webframework like:
* Using the MVP Pattern
* Visual designer
* Performance optimization
* Integration in JEE and Spring
* Testing
* Extending Vaadin

# The location and schedule
The event took place in a conference hotel located in Frankfurt (Main). The room was large enough for round about 60 paying(!) attendes and 6 vaadin experts. Every talk was about 45 minutes, followed by a 15 minute break. The talk length were pretty good but the breaks were a little bit short cause the room for refreshments, coffee and restrooms were located in a different section of the floor. The conference started at 9.00 so I could make I there by getting up pretty early and driving home the same day which is nice. This schedule made it difficult to to some networking or smalltalk with other developers or the vaadin team.
 
# The benefits
The talks were made by experts who could answer all questions. It is always good to get information directly from the core framework developers and I really enjoyed being there. Some talks had IMHO to much slides and didn't show much code. For a developer day I expected to see some more coding. I also were a little bit disapointed some talks were more of a training and not "real world problems". Missed some remarks about "things you should not but do have to do" or some workarounds, about lazy loading. 

# Lessons learned
Nevertheless I've learned a lot.
Here are my personal lessons learned:
* For larger application you should implement _MVP_ with an EventBus
* Vaadin works well with *Spring* or *JEE* both a first class citizens
* Consider using the [Vaadin testbench](https://vaadin.com/add-ons/testbench). It supports you really well for writing maintainable end to end test.
* You can create your own (custom) components which are based on [Polymere](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)
