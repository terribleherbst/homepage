# Javaland 2016

I've visited the german Javaland conference 2016. It was a lot of fun begin a _Phantasialand_ again.

# New thinks

Every conference addresses different kinds of people. So there is always something new and some things you already new. 

* [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) is bringing asynchronous support to the java platform. But it seems to be a all or nothing approach. It is very interesting but I guess I won't use it in the next month.
* The spring platform is _the_ java cloud thing. Spring is "Java in the Cloud" and the spring platform is really awesome. You shoul visit [http://start.spring.io] and look at youtube for talks of Josh Long
* I have heard a great talk about [mutation testing](http://pitest.org/quickstart/maven/). Didn't now anything about this before, I'll give it a chance.
* Feature flags are pretty old but actually I'm not using them. I should really give them a try. Maybe with [Archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius/wiki/Users-Guide) or Spring runtime configuration.
* Gradle is getting better and better. There are so much configuration option and you can really customize the build for you personal needs. If you got a chance, change your build system to gradle. There will be lot of more enterprise features in the upcoming 3.0 version.
* Java has some boilerplate. Also the way it works is pretty dirty, take a look at [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/index.html). It can help you to avoid a lot of boilerplate code. It is also a great tool for creating value objects.
* I had the chance listening to a talk MDD. I like this approach a lot but I'm still not sure if I _can_ apply it to my day to day project work.

All together I've noticed the stuff I use in my projects is pretty much up to date. There are always some new thing I should have a look at and you can always improve your codebase but all together I really love my stuff and java is a really impressive and very stable platform.
