## The Nature of IT projects

IT projects have come a pretty long way. We have seen project different project styles and management methods. At university I was told the _Rational Unified process_ is the final stage of IT project management. But this wasn`t true. Today we see a complete different IT project style. Everything is *agile*, no more waterfall and project phases.

## The age of cloud

Modern build tools has brought us continuous integration in the first and continuous delivery in the second phase. Test has become an integrated part of the development test, started from unit testing in first phase leading to automated integration and acceptance test.

Cloud based infrastructure allows to be much more flexible when creating services and deploying our software. Servers can be created within a few minutes, rollouts are done by using a simple server command.

## Sprint is not agile

So when everythink is so fexible and dynamic, why do projects still fail? Of course there are multiple reasons why a project _may_ fail, but in most cases the problem is, that the project is not agile in nature. The team does sprints, there is a product owner and they deliver early and often, but in most enterprises there is also a project plan with features and budget. So they team fullfills the projec goals, but the project goals doesn`t match with company goals.

## Change of culture

To keep track with disrupting changes in the industry, you must change your company culture. IT must be come a core part of the company. This means you have to stop thinking as IT in terms of projects, which you start and will be finished one day. Like every core business activity IT will be finished when you quit your business. IT must not be longer some kind of helper department which installs computures and provides an email server, IT must become the engine which drivers your business and (big) data is oil which keeps them running.

This doesn`t mean IT is more more important than other sections of your comapny, it means IT is a part of everything. You must enable each section of your company with IT (business) experts, not necessarly programmers, but people who have a strong understanding of chances of digital transformation.

## All projects fail

As long as you think of IT as projects and being done your are still thinking the wrong way. There is not IT strategy and there are no IT projects when applying digital transformation. Your business is an IT business, if it`s not, you got to change it.`
