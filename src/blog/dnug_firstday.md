## DNUG has started
Today the german DNUG conference has started. Jack Welsh just gave a keynote about the *IBM mail next* project which will be presented next week in New York. He also spoke about Domino on Bluemix.

## IBM is reinventing mail

Mail next is **not** a new mail client and at least a new version of the Notes Client is a complete new client. There was just a *click demo* of the user interface and Mr. Welsh just told us about the ideas behind mail next.
Some of you will know, I'm a great fan of managed evolution, meaning technology and organisational shifts going side by side. I guess *IBM mail next* is one of this things:

* It's a *cloud first* solution, it will be available in the cloud soon, on premises during 2015
* Mail next will use a Dashboard instead of an inbox
* Mail next can handle Todos, you can create a todo direct from your inbox.
* Mail next will integrate blog posts


## Domino is going to Bluemix
Finally! They've done it! I'm on the Bluemix platform since the closed beta. [IBM Bluemix](www.bluemix.net) is a plattform as a service, including open source services and a lot of IBM stuff. You can join this plattform for free and try the latest technology.
Nearly every service is available in a free tier, so you can try **Watson** or other latest IBM technologies for free.
So as a domino developer, join Bluemix and get familiar. IBM Domino is not available yet but it will be availabe soon. So even if your company is dropping notes as an email client you can still use your Domino application. I'll provide you with more details as soon as I know.
