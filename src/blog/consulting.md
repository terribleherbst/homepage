# Consultants are evil

To be honest: Most of my professional live I've been working as a software consultant. So I guess, I know what I'm talking about. I've always done my best to satisfy my customers, but after all it might no be the best option for my clients to hire me. 

## Modern soldiers

In my eyses consultants are modern soldiers. They work for every client who is paying them (well) so you can't be sure to get the same guys you hired last time when you need help later. But business is much more complex than the art of (ancient) war. It takes much more than to arm them with a laptop to get them into business. It takes you a lot of time and money to get them just able to do any real work for you. You are paying eduction for people who are complete out of your control!

For some strange reason hiring software engineers as consultants is much more common than any other engineers. I don't know why, but if __software eats the world__ software is a __very critical__ part of your business. You should definitely get this part under your control! I'm sure you got some contract to make sure the guys you hired are telling nobody else about your business, but can you really rely on that? Can you verify it? Remember they are soldiers, they work for you because you pay them.

Software consultants know nothing about your business. Most consulting companies ofer you some kind of "business" or "software" consultant. To be honest, what you get is some more or less intelligent people with some technical background. In most cases these people have now background with your business or even your industry! They are working for some manufacturer today, after they did a job at a telecommuication company before and before that maybe some ecommerce thing. Do you really think, this guys will help you to develp the future of your business? You are handling the core part of your company to someone who has no knowledge about what you are doing, do you really think this is a good idea?

## Tranforming your business

The main reason you should not hire a consultant is, a consultant will bleed but he won't die for you. Meaning a consulting will do the things you pay him for and if he (or his company) doesn't fullfill the contract he will pay his dept, no more nor less. Although you might get some money (back) this doesn't help for your business. You need people who belive in your company! There is no longer a digital strategy, just a corporate strategy using digital tools. You'll need a team not an army of soldiers! Most sucessfull startups have realized teams make the difference.  Only people who know your business, who live your business, can help you to transform your company into the digital work. Make sure you get a team which is interested in your success not in your money.

Get rid of consultants.  Hire your people for your business and you'll survive in the digital world!
