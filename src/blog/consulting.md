# Consultants are evil

To be honest most of my professional live I've been working as a software consultant. I've always done my best to satisfie my customer, but I guess hiring me was after all no the best option for my clients.

## Modern soldiers

Consultants are modern soldiers. They work for every client who is paying them (well) so you can't be sure to get the same guys you hired last time. But business is much more complex than the art of (ancient) war, so it'll take you a lot of time and money to get those people just able to do any productive work. You are paying eduction for people who are complete out of your control!

For some strange reasing hiring software engineer as consultants is much more common than any other engineers. I don't know why, but if __software eats the world__ software will be the _most critical_ part of your business. You should definitely get these part under your control and not in the hands of some strange suit wearing business guys. I'm sure you got some contract to make sure they are telling nobody else about your business, but can you really rely on that? Remember they are soldiers, they work for you because you pay them.

They now nothing about your business. Most people offer you some kind of "business" or "software" consultant. To be honest, what you get is some more or less intelligent people with some technical background. In most cases these people have now background with your business or even your industry! So you are handling the core part of your business to someone who has no knowledge about your work, do you really think this is a good idea?

## Tranforming your business

The main reason you should not hire a consultant is, a consultant will bleed but he won't die for you. Meaning a consulting will do the things you pay him for and if he (or his company) doesn't fullfill he will pay his dept, no more nor less. Although you might get some money (back) this doesn't help for your business. There is no longer a digital strategy, just a corporate strategy using digital tools. You'll need people using these tools as part of your core team. Only people who know your business, who live your business can help you to transform your company into the digital work.

Get rid of consultants.  Hire people who will transform your business to survive in the digital world!
