My name is Joerg Herbst. I'm a IT developer located in Hannover, Germany. As a professional I'm doing mostly java web stuff, based on JEE technologies, but getting more and more exited about new things like NoSQL, Cloud or mobile devices. 


This blog is about my daily work, tools I'm using in my daily live. Experiences as a software developer and new technology or interesting articles about IT.
